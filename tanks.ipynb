    "# German Tank Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "\"In the statistical theory of estimation, the German tank problem consists of estimating the maximum of a discrete uniform distribution from sampling without replacement. In simple terms, suppose there exists an unknown number of items which are sequentially numbered from 1 to $N$. A random sample of these items is taken and their sequence numbers observed; the problem is to estimate $N$ from these observed numbers\" - Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is motivated by problems that real statisticians faced during World War 2; The Allies wanted to estimate the amount of tanks that the Germans were producing, and they used serial numbers on captured tanks to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem\n",

    "Below, we have provided three methods for estimating the maximum number $N$ based on a sample. Note that $m$ is the maximum value in the sample and $n$ is the sample size\n",
