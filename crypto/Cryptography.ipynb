    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose Wally the Wart (Wally) is at Harvey Mudd College in Claremont California and the Three-Eyed Alien (TEA) is on the moon! TEA has discovered the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything; and it's not 42!\n",
    "\n",
    "TEA desparately wants to tell Wally the _real_ answer, but there's a problem; their communications are being monitored by the dastardly picobot.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How can TEA and Wally communicate without picobot knowing the contents of their messages?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want picobot to know the letters in a message. We might consider encrypting the letters somehow (ceasar cipher??). However, this would require Wally and TEA to already have some sort of key to the encryption. The problem is that they cannot communicate to create a key because picobot could intercept it!\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight to RSA Key Cryptography is that _everyone_ knows _part_ of how it works! However, it is practically impossible for anyone to decrypt a message without knowing _all_ of how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "The RSA system (named after its inventors R. Rivest, A. Shamir, and L. Adleman) does this by taking advantage of the difficulty of finding the prime factorization of large numbers!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must be able to convert letters to numbers and vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Most characters (letters of the alphabet, numbers, kanji, etc) have some unique ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) designation number. \n",
    "- For example, the letter 'e' has number 101, the letter 'a' has number '97', and the letter 'r' has letter 114 (and yes capitalization makes a difference!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step towards a solution is to convert strings to numbers and vice versa. Converting strings to numbers is easy, but converting numbers to strings requires a little more thought. Most important English characters can be represented as 2 or 3 digit numbers. For consistency, we will make every number a 3 digit number by adding leading zeroes\n",
    "- For example, the word 'ear' can be represented as the number '101097114' \n",
    "- NOT '10197114'\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, python does not allow integers to have leading zeroes... so let's create strings of numbers instead!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your first task is to write two functions: \n",
    "- `letterToNumber(string)` takes a string and converts it to a long number that holds the ASCII representations of the characters in the string. For example, 'ear' should become '101,097,114'\n",
    "\n",
    "- `numberToLetter(num)` does the reverse! It takes a long number that holds the ASCII representations of the characters in the string and converts it to a string. For example, '101,097,114' should become 'ear'"
